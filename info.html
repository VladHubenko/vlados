    <h1>Interesting Facts</h1>
    <p>
        Ukrainian Hutsuls are creative people with a rich ethnic culture.

Hutsuls are an integral and very colorful part of the Ukrainian ethnos. Only the fact that these people live in the Carpathians suggests the remarkable strength of spirit of the Hutsuls. For centuries, they draw vital energy from amazing nature, which fascinates, inspires, beckons... Having seen the majesty of the mountain tops and the color palette of nature in front of you at least once in your life, you understand that only here you can breathe fully, only here the air rings like crystal.

It is no secret that there were extremely talented craftsmen. Everything they do with their own hands simply breathes authenticity. Hutsul Easter eggs, wooden and ceramic products, embroidery, towels, couches and much more have long earned the reputation of great artistic values.

Hutsul dishes do not stop winning the hearts of gourmets from all over the world, because everything in the Carpathians is prepared according to ancient recipes and from ecologically clean products. In turn, Hutsul folklore occupies a special place among all Ukrainian folklore. Rhymes, songs, fairy tales, legends, parables and tales - everything is woven into a crown of unique Hutsul oral folk art.

My dear love, don't forget me

I will not forget you, I will live later.

I won't forget you and I don't forget,

Where I go and what I do, I think about you.

Oh, remind me, my dear, three times a day,

And I will remember you seven times an hour.

Not a single tourist guide in the Carpathians will miss the Hutsul mythology and will definitely say: "Here, at night, the monkeys conduct their deadly dance with the lemurs, who could not resist the beauty of the forest princesses...".

The Carpathians are a place where a person can be himself, a place where the heart is filled with true feelings. Mountains teach us to live truthfully and appreciate every moment of life. So don't wait a minute, come to a picturesque corner of Hutsul Oblast in the village of Mykulychyn - Hotel KLEN.

    <h1>Drimba </h1>
    <p>
        Drimba is the smallest and lightest Hutsul instrument. It is very old. They make a drum from metal. It is played in a major key. It is mainly a female instrument. The working range of the drimba is quite modest, but it gives the opportunity to play various Hutsul melodies: carols, kolomyika, wedding songs.

In order to make a sound from the drum, it is necessary to put it to the lips and set in motion a thin plate-tongue, which the Hutsuls call a copper. Next, the performer delivers the melody with an inspiratory hissing whistle.

    <h1>Dovbush</h1>
    <p>
        For two centuries, the name of Oleksa Dovbush has been iconic for the Hutsul region, although his biography is shrouded in mystery. The most controversial is the date of his birth - 1700-1, as well as the place of birth - the town of Pechenezhyn in the Kolomyia Hutsul Region. The writer V. Stefak found in the documents that the area where O. Dovbush's late father lived once belonged to the village of Rungurs. However, his place of birth was established in Pechenezhyn thanks to academician V. Grabovetskyi, who did the most to glorify O. Dovbush.

O. Dovbush gathered a band of brave ruffians and with them in the 1730s robbed his own and other people's rich people in Hutsul Region, Pokut and Boykiv Region. The Polish lords hunted for Dovbush, sent punitive squads against him, but without success. Finally, what others could not do, they did their own. True, there was one thing but...Until recently there was an unwritten law among the Hutsuls, when a man could have, in addition to a woman, a mistress (lyubaska). The leader of the Opryshks also took advantage of this ancient right and fell in love with the wife of the Kosmat landlord Shtefan Dzvinchuk. Apparently, he was very indignant that his wife's lover was not some decent landlord, but a robber, and he decided to take revenge on Dovbusheva. Well, what happened next was as it is sung in the song: Dzvinchuk shot from the attic at Dovbush when he started to break down the door. It happened in the summer of 1745.

The dead body was brought to Kolomyia and quartered. To the horror of the Hutsuls, he was hanged in 12 villages and towns. However, the Opryshki movement in the mountains did not stop...

    <h1>Hutsul road</h1>
    <p>
        Utsulas like to stick to their homes, their native mountains. However, fate threw them around the world. Until the 18th century from the Hutsul villages bordering the Pokut villages, prasols left with carts of salt to Podillia and all the way to Dnieper Ukraine. In those days, Hutsul opryshki sometimes hid as far as Wallachia. Managerial mountain loggers went to earn money in the forests of Romania, the Czech Republic, and Serbia. During the USSR, Hutsul craftsmen could be seen on many new buildings: they did joinery, laid tops and floors, carved doors and shelves, benches and tables. The Hutsul wooden architectural style traveled to other areas of Ukraine.

Now there is a great demand for talented Hutsul carpenters and carvers. Some of them, sitting at home, have so many orders that they spend all day and all night near the machines. Others in various brigades stand in the rain and wind on the gigantic buildings of St. Petersburg or Warsaw. And although new times have given rise to new technologies and new requirements, still the master remains the main thing. And the Hutsul was once and remains good with an ax, cutter, hammer and planer.
